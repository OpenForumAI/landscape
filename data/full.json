This project aims to operationalize principles of Trustworthy AI within the development of customized applications of open source Large Language Models (LLMs) with the goal of providing a pragmatic planning guide and toolkit for student/faculty project teams. This will be achieved through the practical examination of development processes utilized by student/faculty teams working on LLM-based projects (e.g., custom chatbot for a history course); with specific focus on student/faculty teams without Computer Science backgrounds. The project will utilize a combination of the NIST Trustworthy AI Risk Management framework [1], the CISA Secure by Design framework [2], and Open Source/Science principles [3, 4, 5] to guide these teams. The outcome will include the development of a consolidated framework and comprehensive toolkit (including a repository of best practices) aimed at enhancing the trustworthiness, security, and openness of AI applications in academic settings."},{"category":"Research","homepage_url":"https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/responsible-ai/index.html","id":"research--design-architecture--responsible-ai","logo":"logos/ef66c59356aca77521dc5751ad298391e54f4443c39b8d3d304fd15857fd3071.svg","name":"Responsible AI","subcategory":"Design/architecture","website":"https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/responsible-ai/index.html","description":"CMU's Responsible AI initiative brings together researchers and educators spanning computer science, engineering, decision sciences, philosophy, arts, economics, psychology, public policy, statistics, and business to make progress in: Translating research to policy and social impact: translating research insights into policy and positive social impact.Building community and serving our local and global communities: collaborating and co-designing with local communities and the public at large.

Researchers from academia, industry, and nonprofits are invited to deploy their best computational methods to predict molecules that will bind to a predefined target linked to a specific disease, a critical step in the drug discovery pipeline known as hit-finding. Their predictions are evaluated and benchmarked in a state-of-the-art laboratory, by our partners at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC). All the benchmarked results are shared openly and publicly with the world, and all chemical structures are made available without patent to all."},{"category":"Community Engagement","homepage_url":"https://opensource.org/deepdive","id":"community-engagement--code--osi-open-source-ai-definition","logo":"logos/ae0c675bdab7ed13b18045e32840e900026600d33245ed6b5e5549eeff66cfac.svg","name":"OSI Open Source AI Definition","subcategory":"Code","website":"https://opensource.org/deepdive","description":"The Open Source AI Deep Dive project by the Open Source Initiative is a global, multi-stakeholder effort to define what constitutes \"Open Source AI.\" It seeks to create a framework for AI systems that ensures transparency, collaboration, and the four freedoms (use, study, share, modify).
