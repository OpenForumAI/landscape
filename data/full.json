This project aims to operationalize principles of Trustworthy AI within the development of customized applications of open source Large Language Models (LLMs) with the goal of providing a pragmatic planning guide and toolkit for student/faculty project teams. This will be achieved through the practical examination of development processes utilized by student/faculty teams working on LLM-based projects (e.g., custom chatbot for a history course); with specific focus on student/faculty teams without Computer Science backgrounds. The project will utilize a combination of the NIST Trustworthy AI Risk Management framework [1], the CISA Secure by Design framework [2], and Open Source/Science principles [3, 4, 5] to guide these teams. The outcome will include the development of a consolidated framework and comprehensive toolkit (including a repository of best practices) aimed at enhancing the trustworthiness, security, and openness of AI applications in academic settings."},{"category":"Technical Prototypes","homepage_url":"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/","id":"technical-prototypes--data--dare-analysis-tools","logo":"logos/fe03f6772fddb67d262845d666d586dd4e51747af33e345764e892975873e80a.svg","name":"DARE Analysis Tools","subcategory":"Data","website":"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/","description":"The D.A.R.E. system analyzes qualitative datasets to reduce administrative burden and increase efficiency, from surveys to transcripts.
