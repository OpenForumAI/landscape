This project aims to operationalize principles of Trustworthy AI within the development of customized applications of open source Large Language Models (LLMs) with the goal of providing a pragmatic planning guide and toolkit for student/faculty project teams. This will be achieved through the practical examination of development processes utilized by student/faculty teams working on LLM-based projects (e.g., custom chatbot for a history course); with specific focus on student/faculty teams without Computer Science backgrounds. The project will utilize a combination of the NIST Trustworthy AI Risk Management framework [1], the CISA Secure by Design framework [2], and Open Source/Science principles [3, 4, 5] to guide these teams. The outcome will include the development of a consolidated framework and comprehensive toolkit (including a repository of best practices) aimed at enhancing the trustworthiness, security, and openness of AI applications in academic settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Design/architecture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
