            description: The Design Decisions that Make LLM Development Projects Open, Secure, and Trustworthy. This project aims to operationalize principles of Trustworthy AI within the development of customized applications of open source Large Language Models (LLMs) with the goal of providing a pragmatic planning guide and toolkit for student/faculty project teams. This will be achieved through the practical examination of development processes utilized by student/faculty teams working on LLM-based projects (e.g., custom chatbot for a history course); with specific focus on student/faculty teams without Computer Science backgrounds. The project will utilize a combination of the NIST Trustworthy AI Risk Management framework [1], the CISA Secure by Design framework [2], and Open Source/Science principles [3, 4, 5] to guide these teams. The outcome will include the development of a consolidated framework and comprehensive toolkit (including a repository of best practices) aimed at enhancing the trustworthiness, security, and openness of AI applications in academic settings.

Researchers from academia, industry, and nonprofits are invited to deploy their best computational methods to predict molecules that will bind to a predefined target linked to a specific disease, a critical step in the drug discovery pipeline known as hit-finding. Their predictions are evaluated and benchmarked in a state-of-the-art laboratory, by our partners at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC). All the benchmarked results are shared openly and publicly with the world, and all chemical structures are made available without patent to all.

            description: We present Basis-to-Basis (B2B) operator learning, a novel approach for learning operators on Hilbert spaces of functions based on the foundational ideas of function encoders. We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces, and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least-squares to compute the coefficients.
