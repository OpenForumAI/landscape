GNS code is a viable surrogate for numerical methods such as Material Point Method, Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Computational Fluid dynamics. GNS exploits distributed data parallelism to achieve fast multi-GPU training. The GNS code can handle complex boundary conditions and multi-material interactions.

We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces, and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least-squares to compute the coefficients."}]
