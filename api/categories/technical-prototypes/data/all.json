Researchers from academia, industry, and nonprofits are invited to deploy their best computational methods to predict molecules that will bind to a predefined target linked to a specific disease, a critical step in the drug discovery pipeline known as hit-finding. Their predictions are evaluated and benchmarked in a state-of-the-art laboratory, by our partners at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC). All the benchmarked results are shared openly and publicly with the world, and all chemical structures are made available without patent to all."},{"category":"Technical Prototypes","homepage_url":"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/","id":"technical-prototypes--data--creative-commons-open-infrastructure-of-sharing","logo_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/logos/1b87aaf306ed8ed47734ffbfd19c77fb460308ef8383dc87f155cc6db3c27b12.svg","name":"Creative Commons Open Infrastructure of Sharing","subcategory":"Data","description":"CC serves as the legal layer of the open infrastructure of sharing, which is an essential digital public good. Our goal is to enable a strong and resilient open infrastructure that empowers sharing and access in the public interest. The CC licenses ensure that humans and machines benefit from the commons in ways that serve the public good. The commons that are fostered by open practices and open licenses are also an essential part of ensuring open datasets for a public AI ecosystem."},{"category":"Technical Prototypes","homepage_url":"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/","id":"technical-prototypes--data--dare-analysis-tools","logo_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/logos/fe03f6772fddb67d262845d666d586dd4e51747af33e345764e892975873e80a.svg","name":"DARE Analysis Tools","subcategory":"Data","description":"The D.A.R.E. system analyzes qualitative datasets to reduce administrative burden and increase efficiency, from surveys to transcripts.
